This is some of the code I have been practicing on for REST API development. 

It is a CRUD API where Product, Sale and Client models are represented, interconnected using SQL tables, and Spring boot as framework. In addition to the CRUD API, in this exercise there is code to do the following:

Obtain all products whose quantity is lower than 5.

Obtain all the products from a certain sale.

Obtain total amount sold and quantity of products sold on a certain date.

Obtain Sale Code, total, quantity of products, Full name of client of the highest sale of all.



Every package is separated and easy to understand.

This exercise is in Spanish. I will create more projects using English.
